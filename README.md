# Codes to compare the retrieval of impulse response function amplitudes with different methods ([Viens et al., 2017, GJI)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/1/210/3747441)

## Description:
This repository contains the functions used in [Viens et al. (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/1/210/3747441) along with an example.

* The Code folder contains:
  - Functions_GJI_2017.py -> Functions to compute cross-correlation, deconvolution, coherency of raw data, and cross-correlation of 1-bit data.
  - Interferometry.py -> runs the different techniques on 1 day of data recorded at "station_1" and "station_2". 
  - station_1_1d.sac -> 1 day of data with a sampling rate of 4 Hz at station 1.
  - station_2_1d.sac -> Same at station 2.
  - Foo.png -> Output of Interferometry.py.

In this example, the anticausal and causal parts are strongly asymmetric due to the location of the noise sources (Station_1 is closer to the ocean than Station_2).
