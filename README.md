# Python codes to compare the retrieval of impulse response functions with different methods ([Viens et al., 2017, GJI](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/1/210/3747441))

## Description:
This repository contains the functions used in [Viens et al. (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/1/210/3747441) along with an example.

In this example, Station 1 and Station 2 are two MeSO-net stations located in the Kanto region, Japan. The distance between the two stations is 8.26 km. Therefore, the waves observed in the causal (positive) part between ~10 and 25 s are likely Rayleigh waves. Note that the anti-causal (negative) and causal parts are strongly asymmetric due to the station locations, with Station 1 being closer to the Pacific Ocean than Station 2. Spurious arrivals near the zero time-lag can also be observed and disappear when the correlation functions are stacked over a longer time period.

This repository contains:
* **Codes** folder:
  - Functions_GJI_2017.py: Functions to compute cross-correlation, deconvolution, coherency of raw data, and cross-correlation of 1-bit data.
  - Interferometry.py: runs the different techniques on 1 day of data recorded at "station_1" and "station_2". 
* **Data** folder:
  - station_1_1d.sac: 1 day of vertical data with a sampling rate of 4 Hz at station 1.
  - station_2_1d.sac: 1 day of vertical data with a sampling rate of 4 Hz at station 2.
