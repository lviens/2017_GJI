# Viens et al. (2017, GJI)
This repository contains the functions and an example for the paper:
- Loïc Viens, Marine Denolle, Hiroe Miyake, Shin’ichi Sakai, Shigeki Nakagawa; Retrieving impulse response function amplitudes from the ambient seismic field. Geophys J Int 2017 ggx155. doi: 10.1093/gji/ggx155

The functions to computed cross-correlation, deconvolution, coherency of raw data, and cross-correlation of 1-bit data are in the Functions_GJI_2017.py file.

The Interferometry.py code runs the different techniques on 1 day of data recorded at "station_1" and "station_2". 

station_1_1d.sac -> 1 day of record with a sampling rate of 4 Hz at station 1.

station_2_1d.sac -> Same at station 2.
